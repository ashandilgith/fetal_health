📌 Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting fetal health status based on cardiotocogram (CTG) test results. The system uses a neural network built with TensorFlow to classify fetal states as Normal, Suspect, or Pathological.

The goal is to assist healthcare professionals by providing quick, reliable decision support in prenatal care.

📊 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains CTG features extracted from cardiotocograms and a target label:

Normal

Suspect

Pathological

Features include:

Baseline fetal heart rate

Accelerations

Fetal movements

Uterine contractions

... and more (21 total clinical indicators)

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Pandas / NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

(Optional: Streamlit / FastAPI for web deployment)
